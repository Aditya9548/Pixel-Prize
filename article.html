                    <p>The art of composition refers to the deliberate arrangement of visual
                    elements within a frame to create a compelling image. A well-composed
                    photograph can guide the viewer's eye, convey emotion, and tell a
                    story.</p>
        
                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        Effective composition elevates photos by directing focus and evoking
                        emotion through various techniques.

                        <p>Key techniques include the rule of thirds, where the frame is divided
                        into nine equal parts and important elements are placed along these
                        lines or intersections. Leading lines can draw attention to the subject,
                        while framing techniques, like shooting through a window or arch, add
                        depth. Balancing elements ensures that no part of the image overwhelms
                        another, creating harmony. By mastering composition, photographers can
                        elevate ordinary scenes into captivating works of art.</p>

                        The art of color grading in photography involves adjusting and enhancing the colors of an image to achieve a desired mood or aesthetic.
